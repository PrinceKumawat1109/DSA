Example 1:

Input: N = 4, K = 0
Output: No
Explanation: Binary representation of 4 is 100, 
in which 0th bit from LSB is not set. 
So, return false.

Example 2:

Input: N = 4, K = 2
Output: Yes
Explanation: Binary representation of 4 is 100, 
in which 2nd bit from LSB is set. 
So, return true.

Example 3:

Input: N = 500, K = 3
Output: No
Explanation: Binary representation of 500 is 
111110100, in which 3rd bit from LSB is not set. 
So, return false.


Solution:

package Solution;

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int t=sc.nextInt();
		while(t-->0)
		{
			int n=sc.nextInt();
			int k=sc.nextInt();
			if((n&(1<<(k-1)))>0)
				System.out.println("YES");
			else
				System.out.println("NO");
		}
	}
}
